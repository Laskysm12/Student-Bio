<p>I was born in Roanoke, Virginia in 1990 and attended James Madison University, where I earned a B.A. in International Affairs.  
    I Love travelling the world and spent the last two years living in Madrid, Spain, where I taught English to Spaniards and worked
    for a company called Citylife Madrid as a promoter.  I currently live in Charlotte, North Carolina and I am studying web development
    at UNC Charlotte.  So far I love living in Charlotte!
